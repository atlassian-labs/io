## Performance tools I/O

This module defines extra I/O mechanisms.

### Version management
SCM is an ultimate source of truth about project version, and you will not find it hardcoded in the source code.
To get the current version of the project from Git to execute `./gradlew currentVersion`.

### Releasing
To release a new version of the project execute `./gradlew release`.
You should release a new version only from the *master* branch.
To publish a new version execute `./gradlew publish`. The project is configured to publish its versions to Atlassian 
*maven-private* repository, and *SNAPSHOT* versions are published to Atlassian *maven-private-snapshot* repositories instead.

#### Marking new version
If you wish to mark a new *major* / *minor* version simply execute ` ./gradlew markNextVersion -Prelease.version=**version**`. 
For example to start a new version `0.2.0` execute ` ./gradlew markNextVersion -Prelease.version=0.2.0`.
